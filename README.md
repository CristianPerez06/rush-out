A React application built with TypeScript and Vite.

## Tech Stack

- **React** - UI library
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Vite** - Build tool and dev server
- **ESLint** - Code linting
- **Prettier** - Code formatting

## Initial setup

### Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have installed:

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher recommended)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

### Installation and Execution

1. **Install dependencies**:

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

2. **Start the development server**:

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

3. **Open the application**:
   After executing the previous command, Vite will start the dev server. Open the URL shown in the terminal (typically `http://localhost:5173`) in your browser.

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start the development server
- `npm run build` - Build the application for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview the production build locally
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint to check for code issues
- `npm run format` - Format code using Prettier
- `npm run format:check` - Check if code is properly formatted
